# MicroPython driver for the amazing SHT30 temperature and humidity sensor 

So I made this because the original repo wouldn't run. There are/were some Python functions in there that didn't work in MicroPython. It now runs successfully (on an ESP32 WROOM). 

I've used this SHT30 module: [link](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/134684976674?chn=ps&mkevt=1&mkcid=28).

I've included a very simple example with non-blocking printing. For more methods and general info, visit the [original repo](https://github.com/rsc1975/micropython-sht30).
